The idea behind the algorithm is that once the array is sorted, we'll go to the middle of the array and 
there we'll split the array in two, where we'll evaluate the value in inches of the player at that position.
If the height is greater than what we need, we can discard the array on the right, since there are only 
higher values that do not serve us. The same if the height is smaller, we would discard the arrangement on the left. 
So on until we find the value we are looking for. Once the desired value is found, using two functions we will 
see if there are adjacent neighbors that have the same height, so they would also meet the condition.
Each loop will only go through the array if there is a neighbor with the height, otherwise it will just stop.

Every time a player is found that meets the condition, it is added to the solutions. Then, remove the player from 
the player array (to avoid duplicates and repetitive comparisons) and continue with the next player until the end.
